I'm shocked folks -- seriously.

    Last year, consumers paid $32 billion in overdraft fees, a $400 million jump from 2011 according to a recent study by Moebs Services. This 1.3% increase came almost entirely from a greater number of overdrafts rather than an increase in the price of the fee.

Remember that one of the (few) things The Fed has done to make the banking system a bit more fair was to require that instead of "Opting Out" of such fees consumers had to opt in.

It didn't change anything, however -- the scarmongering by banks clearly has worked, or we wouldn't see figures like this.

If you think about it, with 330 million Americans (more or less) this means that the average American paid $100 in overdraft fees.  That's outrageous -- remember that there are roughly 100 million people outside working age and for those over the median income they're unlikely to get hammered by this.

That implies that the lower two quintiles of the working-age population is paying something close to $400 a year in overdraft fees, which is damned close to a month's rent for a lower-end flat or apartment!

This is a flat outrage and I'm willing to bet that nearly all of it is coming from debit card access and other similar acts where the person in question doesn't realize they're overdrawn until after it happens.

Don't expect the banksters to be stopped from this act of raw theft from those least able to afford it -- the scaremongering the banksters use in this regard (e.g. "But you might bounce a rent check if you don't have this on your account!") is ridiculous.

Indeed, I've had them try to run that crap on me, despite the fact that I am certainly not in the "at risk" population group.
